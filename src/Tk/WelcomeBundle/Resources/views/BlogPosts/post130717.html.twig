		After a hard day of work launching Twinkler, there's nothing better than a game of Jokari to relax with friends! For those who don't know, the Jokari is a game where a rubber ball is attached to an anchor by a long elastic band, which makes the ball come back when you hit it. This sounds quite dumb but it's amazingly really fun!
		<br>
		We met our friends from the newly formed Paris Jokari Club. They welcomed us on a beautiful rooftop in the heart of Paris. It was the perfect occasion to try our brand new website to share this moment! <br>
		We hope you'll like it as much as we did last night!
