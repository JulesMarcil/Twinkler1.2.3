				</a>
				<p>We are excited to annouce you the official release of our brand new iPhone app, it's free and you can <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/twinkler/id702569884">download it here</a>.</p>
				<p><b>The app brings Twinkler to the next step,</b> we have taken all the feedbacks we got from building the website and re designed a new experience for your iPhone. We focused on making three things really usefull and easy: <b>inviting your friends with facebook, adding new expenses quickly and navigating between your different groups smoothly.</b></p>
				<p>We also made sure all your information was accessible offline by caching it into your iPhone memory. Yet you still need an internet connection to add new expenses, thus to make sure there is no conflict with what your friends add in the same time. Of course the website is still live and all your data is fully synchronised and securely safe on our secured servers.</p>
				<p>Last, we would like to come back on a major decision we made. <b>Using "Facebook connect only"</b> for futur users. By conecting with Facebook, you will accept to share no more than your name, your picture, your email and your list of friends with Twinkler. This will enable you to add your friends in a tap from Twinkler and they will just have to download the app or go to the website and login to access all the information. No more link to share or invitation to send. Be sure that all the information you put on Twinkler will not be shared with third parties and we will never post anything in your name (we don't even have the permission for that).</p>
				<p><b>Now we invite you to download Twinkler</b>, enjoy and let us know how you use it on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TwinklerCommunity">Facebook page</a>.</p>
				<p>Have a good day,</p>
				<p>The Twinkler team</p>

					<h3>iOS App pre-release / NYC</h3>
					<img src="{{ asset('img/links/blog/nyc-polaroid.png') }}" alt="NYC">
				</div>
				<h4 align="center">The iPhone app is almost there!</h4>
				<p>
					We are back from a <strong>one-week trip in New York City</strong> where we had the chance to meet very interesting startups and no-longer startups (Kickstarter, YPlan, Twitter, Foursquare) as well as investors (ff Ventures, Betaworks).<br>
					But NYC was not only about learning about other startups, we also used the <strong>not-yet-released iOS app of Twinkler</strong>. Equiped with brand new iPhones 5S we just spent the week <strong>paying for each other</strong> anything and putting it straight away on Twinkler. And I have to admit this was cool.<br>
					Having the possibility to <strong>record an expense immediately</strong> after you made it is a major breakthrough in Twinkler development. Not only we remove the bothering of calculating who owes what but now we completely remove the bothering of remembering expenses.<br>
					After using Twinkler ourselves in NYC, we have made the necessary refinements and submitted it to Apple. We are very excited to show this app to you, stay tuned it is coming very soon!

<!-- HOW TO USE TWINKLER -->

					<h3>How to use Twinkler</h3>
					<img src="{{ asset('img/links/blog/showcase.png') }}" alt="Twinkler showcase">
				</div>
				<p><strong>Twinkler</strong> is still under construction but a lot of people ask us: "who should use Twinkler?" And the best answer I can give is: "You should tell me how you want to use Twinkler!"<br><br>
				Yet it is not like if we had not think about it and we identified 3 people who can take advantage of Twinkler:<br>
				- <strong>Flatmates</strong> are the first users of Twinkler. Because living in a flatshare comes along with arguments on who owes who and who paid what. Twinkler removes all the worry and let flatmates live in harmony.<br>
				- <strong>Holidays with friends</strong> (weekends, trips, ...) are of course a good scenario for using Twinkler. Because with Twinkler, friends will not worry about splitting the bill each time there is an expense or advancing the cash with the fear of never getting paid back. With twinkler, you just enjoy holidays and do the calculation of who owes what in the end.<br>
				- Last, people in <strong>clubs</strong> should of course use Twinkler! Because when you organize football games every sunday, you don't want to chase your friends to know who comes and of course to get the money back for the field you booked. All small clubs should use Twinkler, no need for a boring an accounting software or a spreadsheet no one understands.<br><br>
				Of course if you use Twinkler in any other way, we would love to know about it!<br>
				Cheers.</p>

					<h3>Work hard, play hard!</h3>
					<img src="{{ asset('img/links/blog/jokari.jpg') }}" alt="Jokari on Paris rooftop">
				</div>
				<p>After a hard day of work launching Twinkler, there's nothing better than a game of Jokari to relax with friends! For those who don't know, the Jokari is a game where a rubber ball is attached to an anchor by a long elastic band, which makes the ball come back when you hit it. This sounds quite dumb but it's amazingly really fun!
				<br>
				We met our friends from the newly formed Paris Jokari Club. They welcomed us on a beautiful rooftop in the heart of Paris. It was the perfect occasion to try our brand new website to share this moment! <br>
				We hope you'll like it as much as we did last night!</p>
